When I first began learning Sinatra, I admit that I felt slightly overwhelmed. This was new territory. Although familiar from our time with OO Ruby, something was different. Now we were working with routes and establishing instances between routes in order to keep track of sessions and maintain a connection to key elements in our database. It was a quick jump into dark waters, but somehow... we learn to adapt.

Our labs were the biggest help along the journey. Not everything made sense, and there were times when I could not bring myself to understand some of the concepts we had to drill in our head as a cohort. Luckily, I had my classmates and cohort lead to help. Unfortunately, we were all on holiday vacation during a time when learning Sinatra was at the toughest point for me. So, much the process came down to sucking it up and trying to understand everything before having no choice but to reach out and ask for help. That was the last thing I wanted to do while everyone else was likely spending time with their families.

The point is, anything is possible if you put as much of your own effort in as you can before seeking assistance. However, the challenges didn't stop at Sinatra as a whole. Learning something so complex and new made me realize just how hard it is to retain other technologies/gems despite their ability to work together. For me, I felt like I had to relearn how to scrape. It didn't take so long the second time around, but it was important for me to include it in my project due to how dynamic my scraper was in getting pictures relevant to the vacation plan of a user. If that wasn't challenging enough, my next tough lesson was learning that I could call upon my has_many realtionships method to specify what information is displayed based on the user that is logged in. In my case, this was @user.destinations which was not a direct extension of my database such as if I were to call upon @user.username. 

Over all, learning Sinatra has been a wonderful experience. I feel as though I have truly learned a valuable skill, and yet it only gets better with what comes next. It was tough, but I did it! Despite it taking nearly 12 hours straight to build. I'm starting to really feel like anything in the world of programming is possible to learn if you can just put in the time to understand how and why it works. That's when, in my opinion, even the feeling of imposter syndrome has no room to shine.
