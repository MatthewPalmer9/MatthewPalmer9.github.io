When I first got into the field of information technology (IT), I honestly did not know where to begin. I approached my passion for technology with "I want to be a programmer". The problem here is that "programmer" is a very general title. The question I neglected to ask myself was, "What KIND of programmer?" It's sort of like claiming you really love ***vehicles***. In this case, you wouldn't really be specifying whether or not those vehicles are cars, motorcycles, or trucks.

In regard to programming, what I really wanted to do came down to figuring out what my *flavor* of programming was. I thought it was software development, and to some extent it still is. However, exploring website development is where I felt those little butterflies inside.

Diving deeper into my reasoning for generally getting into IT goes further back into my childhood around the age of twelve. Back in the days of Windows Live Messenger (WLM), my online identity (read: username) on a private server for a game I played was mistaken for official staff of the original game. A group who referred to themselves as "The Defaced" lead by someone who called himself "Deadly Data" forced themselves onto my WLM and began to find out everything they could about me from instantly hacking into my computer and researching my email.

Once they realized that I was not the person they accused me of being, and the fact that I was just some kid, they apologized and offered to answer any questions I had for them. They even provided a demostration of how they accomplish some of their attacks by live streaming their screen to me through Team Viewer. I saw a bunch of scripting that I couldn't understanding and even watched them disable my internet temporarily (around 1 minute) by executing some code.

Ever since, I have been fascinated with technology. I do not aim to commit cyber attacks like The Defaced did (I assume), but code has become such a nostalgic piece of my mind at this point in my life. I want to become the best at what I do by creating top of the line websites that offer only top tier user experiences and services.

Through Flatiron, I aim to take a giant leap and work towards expanding on my passion.
