Throughout my time as a programmer, object-oriented programming (OOP) has become the heart and soul of everything I create. Since programming mimics real life instances, OOP allows for us to work with object models which are a collection of written objects molded by OOP techniques. One great example of what an object model is actually brings us back to our very first project at Flatiron -- CLIs. 

Within my project, I utilized the Social Security Administration's (SSA) website to scrape the top 10 girl and boy names from the most recent / previous year. The entire project could be considered an object model since each method inside has an object in and of itself. For example, the scraper, boy, girl, main cli classes and the methods inside are each used to do a very specific task. They come together even within themselves to execute those tasks in a logical order. There is a very important key factor behind each object. While subliminal, the most important thing we do as programmers is incorporate readability. If we wanted to make things difficult for both ourselves and everyone else reading our code, we could name our methods with irrelevant titles. If I wrote a class that handles song names, it wouldn't quite make sense if I named that class "CakeRecipes" or "CarLicensePlates".

Strategic naming is key to writing beautiful code next to proper indentation. As programmers, it just comes natural to us. However, we overlook how subtile and important it is that we approach written code structures with a logical mind. Object models rely on perfectly executed code to run, but also on the naming of classes and methods within in order to be readable to other programmers seeking to change or improve the entire program.

In conclusion, object models are set up to make our lives easier. When anything goes wrong, we can't blame the computer. It is up to us to keep our code set up for success. Especially when it comes to working in teams where understanding and reading each other's code is paramount and ensures a project is completed on schedule. I have become very aware of this over the last 2 months and plan on utilizing these concepts during my career.
