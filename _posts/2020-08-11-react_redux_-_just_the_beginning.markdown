This is it. My entire journey has lead up to this point. 

When you think about your final project, there is a lot that goes through your mind. A lot of anxiety. A lot of excitement. From the point in which students begin this program, it really is hard to wrap your mind around what you're going to be learning. It's all exciting and fun, but it also kind of feels like you're also looking straight into the fog of Silent Hill! You don't really know where you're going, but all you do know is that *you want to get there*. What you don't see coming, however... is the feeling at the end of the program. It's a mixture of emotions. You stop feeling like a student. You genuinely *feel* like a software engineer. You start feeling the power. The reward. The pride. 

There is something else also... You realize that this is just the beginning. Flatiron School doesn't just teach you how to be a software engineer. It teaches you how to *learn*. Being a software engineer is a never-ending opportunity to learn. That's why it is also so important to fall in love with getting STUCK! Getting stuck in code is uncomfortable and sometimes can last hours. This point in time is very important because it means that you are growing as a developer. Every mistake. Every syntax error is another advancement in your understanding when you destruct your steps to find a solution. Even the moments that do not offer error codes have the capability to teach you something new when the code *works* but *not in the way you intend for it to*.

If I had to describe the hardest part of my final project, I would point my fingers towards Redux. React by itself is fairly easy and straight forward, but Redux takes the entire process to the next level. It's used to help maintain `state` from one place -- the Redux store. It passes in two arguments: a reducer which takes the `state`, and an `action`. In less-technical terms, this makes it easy to manipulate information going to and from an API -- or at least, easy once you get a solid understanding of how Redux works. There is so much more to it, but now I can leave with my newfound knowledge and power at my fingertips.

I'm ready to start the next chapter of my life and career! I hope that any new Flatiron student who finds this article can take some relief and excitement from this post. Reaching the end of the program is sublime, and JUST the beginning of your new life.
